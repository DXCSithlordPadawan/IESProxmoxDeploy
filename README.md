I've created a comprehensive Proxmox Community Script-style deployment solution for the IES Military Database Analyzer. 
Here's what I've delivered:

## Main Components Created:

### 1. **Full Proxmox LXC Deployment Script** (`deploy-ies-lxc.sh`)
- Interactive configuration menu with defaults
- Advanced configuration options
- Comprehensive error handling and validation
- Full application installation with monitoring stack
- Security hardening and firewall configuration

### 2. **Quick One-Line Installer** (`quick-install.sh`)  
- Streamlined deployment for rapid setup
- Uses all defaults unless environment variables are set
- Minimal user interaction required
- Complete functionality in a single script

### 3. **Comprehensive Documentation**
- Detailed installation instructions
- Management and troubleshooting guides
- Security configuration recommendations
- Performance tuning guidance

## Key Features Implemented:

**Default Configuration (as requested):**
- Container ID: 351
- IP Address: 192.168.0.200
- Gateway: 192.168.0.1
- DNS: 192.168.0.110
- Storage: pve1 (corrected from PVE1)
- Password: BobTheBigRedBus-0
- SSH: Enabled
- Cert Server: 192.168.0.122

**Complete Application Stack:**
- IES Military Database Analyzer v3
- Nginx reverse proxy with SSL/TLS
- Prometheus + Grafana monitoring
- Security hardening (UFW, Fail2Ban)
- Management utilities

**Production-Ready Features:**
- Systemd service integration
- Health checks and monitoring
- Automated backups
- Update management
- Comprehensive logging

## Usage Examples:

**Quick deployment:**
```bash
bash <(curl -sSL https://url-to-quick-install.sh)
```

**Custom deployment:**
```bash
./deploy-ies-lxc.sh --ct-id 352 --ip 192.168.0.201 --non-interactive
```

**With environment variables:**
```bash
export CT_ID=353
export IP=192.168.0.202
./quick-install.sh
```

The scripts follow Proxmox Community Script conventions, provide comprehensive error handling, 
and create a fully functional IES deployment with monitoring, security, and management capabilities. 

The configuration file is automatically generated and stored in the container for reference.

All scripts are designed to be run directly from the Proxmox host console and will create a production-ready LXC container with the IES application accessible via HTTPS with proper monitoring and security configurations.
